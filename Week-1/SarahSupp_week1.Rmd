Permute Seminar, Week 1
========================================================

**For Week 2:** read chapters 3-5

**Notes:**
Bootstrap = Sample with replacement

Boostrapped datasets are generally represented using a "*".
Estimates are represented using "^".

Sampling with replacement from original data can take the place of redoing an experiment many times.

**Examples:**
Load the libraries that we will need for examples
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Make a dataset with a mean of 1 and sd of 3
Obtain 1000 bootstrap replicates using random sampling with replacement and take the mean of each
```{r}
data = rnorm(100, 1, 3)
mean(data)

est=NULL
for (i in 1:1000){
  boot = sample(data, 1000, replace=TRUE)
  mean = mean(boot)
  est = append(est, mean)
}
mean(est)
sd(est)
```

Obtain 1000 datasets, and compare the means
```{r}
est2=NULL
for (i in 1:1000){
  data = rnorm(100, 1, 3)
  mean = mean(data)
  est2 = append(est2, mean)
}
mean(est2)
sd(est2)
hist(est2)
```

Compare the histograms directly:
```{r}
means = data.frame(est, est2)

booted = ggplot(means, aes(est)) + geom_histogram()
booted + geom_histogram(aes(est2))

```

**From the text:**
Chapter 1
----------

Aspirin study group data
```{r}
aspirin = c(rep(1,119), rep(0,10918))
placebo = c(rep(1,98), rep(0,10936))
```

obtain 1000 bootstrap replicates for theta using random sampling with replacement
```{r}
est=NULL
for (i in 1:1000){
  bootA = sample(aspirin, 11037, replace=TRUE)
  bootB = sample(placebo, 11034, replace=TRUE)
  theta = (sum(bootA)/length(bootA))/(sum(bootB)/length(bootB))
  est = append(est, theta)
}

hist(est, xlab = "boostrap estimated means")
```

# plot and summarize the results
```{r}
se <- function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))

hist(est)
mean(est)
sd(est)
se(est)
```

# find the confidence intervals
```{r}
quantile(est, 0.95)
quantile(est, 0.05)
```

# Chapter 2

#mouse study data, lifespan (days) after surgical treatment
```{r}
trmt = c(94, 197, 16, 38, 99, 141, 23)
control = c(52, 104, 146, 10, 51, 30, 40, 27, 46)

mean(trmt)
mean(control)
diff = mean(trmt) - mean(control)

se(trmt)
se(control)
sediff = sqrt(se(trmt)^2 + se(control)^2)
```

Thus, the observed difference is only about 1 stderr greater than 0; Insiginificant.
```{r}
diff/sediff
```

Compare the sample medians
```{r}
median(trmt)
median(control)
diff2 = median(trmt) - median(control)
```

Obtain 1000 bootstrap replicates for mean using random sampling with replacement
```{r}
meanA=NULL
meanB=NULL
medianA=NULL
medianB=NULL
for (i in 1:200){
  bootA = sample(trmt, 7, replace=TRUE)
  bootB = sample(control, 9, replace=TRUE)
  meanA = append(meanA, mean(bootA))
  meanB = append(meanB, mean(bootB))
  medianA = append(medianA, median(bootA))
  medianB = append(medianB, median(bootB))
}

seBootA = sd(meanA)
seBootB = sd(meanB)
seBootAm = sd(medianA)
seBootBm = sd(medianB)

#the observed difference in means is less than 1 sd greater than 0
sediff = sqrt(seBootA**2 + seBootB**2)
diff/sediff

# the observed difference in medians is greater than the difference in means, but is still insignificant.
sediff2 = sqrt(seBootAm**2 + seBootBm**2)
diff2/sediff2

#problems:
#2.1 Supoose mouse survival was in weeks instead of days. How would the answers change?
trmt = trmt/7
control = control/7





This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
